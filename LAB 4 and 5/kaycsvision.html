  <h5>ABOUT ME</h5>
  <img class ="kayc" src="assets/IMG_1439 2.jpg" alt="picture of me">
  <p id="bio">
    Hello, my name is KayC LeFever, I'm 25 years old and currently reside in Las Vegas, NV. I'm originally from Guam but Vegas has been my home since I was 4 years old. I moved around a lot when I was younger which exposed me to many different cultures and ways of life. Moving around opened my eyes to the beauty in all things. My passion for beauty started when I was very young. See one thing about me, I was a Bratz girly, which pretty much explains where my passion for hair, nails and makeup came from. I had a Bratz dollhead when I was younger that I would style all the time - we're talking braids, curls, etc. I knew since then that I wanted to pursue a career in the beauty industry. I love everything creative and differet such as bold colors, unique haircuts or funky outfits. There are so many ways to express creativity and for me, hair is where I get to do that. Not only is it therapy for me, I love seeing people look and feel their best.
